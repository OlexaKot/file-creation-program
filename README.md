# File creation program

This program is used to create multiple files at once.

To create the right amount of files with the right names the program asks the user to firstly input 4 parameters.


1) Amount. This parameter corresponds to the amount of files that will be created.
  
2) Parent Folder. This optional parameter corresponds to the path of the folder where the files will be stored. If left unspecified, the files will be stored in the same location as this program. The path can NOT end with a backslash otherwise the program won't work. 

3) Prefix. This parameter is basically almost the whole name of the file. When created, the names of the files will look something like this: my_file2.txt, where "my_file" is the prefix.

4) Extension. This parameter is very self-explanatory. It corresponds to the type of file that will be created. Please also note that the extension you enter MUST start with a dot otherwise the program won't work.

After getting all the required parameters, the files will be created.
